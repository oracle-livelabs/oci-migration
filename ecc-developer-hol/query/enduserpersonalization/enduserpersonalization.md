### Prerequisites 

This lab assumes you have:
* Completed all previous labs successfully 


  

## Task 1: Hands on demo of ECC Receivables

1. Navigate to http://<VNC\_Public\_IP\>:8000 in the browser with below credentials 


    ```
  	 Username: operations
Password: welcome1
    ```
2. Navigate to Receivables Manager -> Receivables Command center 
    ![Receivables](../images/r1.png "Receivables")

3. You will be navigated to the "Outstanding receivables" dashboard. Click on the Ledgers flag and select "Vision Operations (USA)" Ledger from the pop up.
    ![Receivables](../images/r2.png "Receivables")


4. We want to focus on only Past-due invoices, so from the Summarization bar lets only display metrics/dimensions/flags which are relevant to us. Click on the runtime options (three vertical dots) for Summarization Bar, enable the below mentioned items, and then click outside the runtime options of Summarization Bar for changes to reflect.
      * Ledger
      * Currency
      * Past-Due Balance

    ![Receivables](../images/r01.png "Receivables")

    ![Receivables](../images/r0190.png "Receivables")


5. Scroll down to the Transactions List Results Table and click on the "Hide/Show Columns" icon to only focus on attributes as mentioned below. Then, click outside the Hide/Show columns of Results Table for changes to reflect.
     * Transaction number
     * Transaction Type
     * Transaction Date
     * Due Date
     * Transaction Currency
     * Amount Due
     * Bill-To Customer
    ![Receivables](../images/r09.png "Receivables")

6. You made runtime changes in Summarization bar and Results Table, these changes will remain even if you were to log out and login again.
7. In the "Transactions List" Results Table, click on the "Preview" row action for transaction number "524952" to review customer claim by opening the customer invoice. This row action leads to source transaction, i.e., row action to invoice overview for seamless integration with EBS. Click on the hamburger icon within the preview, to view the customer claim clearly.

## Task 2: Hands on demo of ECC General Ledger


**Goal:** Analyze Account Activity and Drilldown to Source Transactions
1. Navigate to http://<VNC\_Public\_IP\>:8000 in the browser with below credentials 


    ```
  	 Username: eccuser
Password: welcome1
    ```
2. You will see the below screen,  from **General Ledger Super User** responsibility navigate to **General Ledger Command Center**  
        ![EBS home screen](../images/genz100.png "EBS home screen")

3. You will see the "Account Analysis" dashboard. If you see any existing filters in the Selected refinements, please remove them and refine the dashboard for "Period Name" attribute with value as "Jun-23" from Available refinements (Click on the side navigation panel to open Available refinements). 
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/changefiltersinglusecase.png "Personalize dashboard")

4. Within the "Account Analysis" dashboard you can see the Trellis chart under the Period Activities tab. We will explore "Expenses" by clicking on "expenses" from the legend in the chart.
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg1.png "Personalize dashboard")

5. Let's explore "Employee Expenses" category
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg2.png "Personalize dashboard")
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg30.png "Personalize dashboard")
6. The highest employee expense account, is "Meals", which is rather odd. Let's explore it further by clicking on "Meals" from the legend in the chart.
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg4.png "Personalize dashboard")

7. To investigate further why "Meals" seems unusally high, let's compare current period amount with previous period. Click on the "Period Name" breadcrumb to add previous period i.e., May-23
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg5.png "Personalize dashboard")
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg6.png "Personalize dashboard")

8. Previous period seems very low compared to what we were investigating, let's compare current period amount with same period last year to check for seasonality i.e., compare Jun-23 with Jun-22. To do that, click on the "Period Name" breadcrumb to add Jun-22
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg7.png "Personalize dashboard")
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg8.png "Personalize dashboard")

9. The amount for "meals" is even higher in the previous year. 
11. Let's explore further and analyze employee expenses by department. Click on the runtime options for "Period Activities by Chart of Accounts" Pivot view and select only the following, and then click outside the runtime options of Pivot component for changes to reflect.
    * Dimensions:
        * Company
        * Department
        * Account
        * Posting status
        * Period name
    * Metrics:
        * Period activity
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg9.png "Personalize dashboard")
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg10.png "Personalize dashboard")

12. Click on the "Period Activities by Account Hierarchy" tab to analyze employee expenses by account hierarchy
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg11.png "Personalize dashboard")
13. Click on the runtime options for the Pivot view and enable "Parent Account 2" and "Parent Account Code 2" attributes and metric "Period activity", whilst keeping the selected dimension attributes as is, and then click outside the runtime options of Pivot component for changes to reflect
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg12.png "Personalize dashboard")
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg13.png "Personalize dashboard")

14. We can see that in Jun-23 we have an usually high amount entered under "Meals" account because of it being accounted under personal expenses, which seems wrong. To investigate this further, click on the "Account Code" for 7690.
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/fg13highlight.png "Personalize dashboard")

15. Click on the diagram icon to navigate to the diagram view
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/y6c.png "Personalize dashboard")

16. From this diagram, you can get to know the journal line details.
        ![Personalize dashboard](../images/f12.png "Personalize dashboard")

17. Now, close the drawer and navigate back to selected refinements and save this search with name as "Review Employee Expenses", so that we can review it again.
* Users can save frequently-applied filters or preferred filters as saved searches, allowing other users to reuse them. All saved searches are context-sensitive to the page and are part of the search suggestions. 
* The list of saved searches appears when the focus is on the search component. Saved searches are searchable by their titles, filter attributes, and filter values. Three types of saved searches are available for users: seeded, public, and private. 
* Seeded saved searches are published along with the product. Administrators can create public saved searches. Users can create their own private saved searches. 
* Private saved searches are accessible only by the users who created them whereas public saved searches are accessible by all the dashboard users.
