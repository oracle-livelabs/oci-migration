# ECC Personalization Template


### Introduction

This lab walks you through the ECC Personalization Template feature, what the feature is, the benefits of this feature and hands on demos.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes






### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Learn about ECC Personalization Template
* Create a new FND function for the dashboard
* Create RBAC setup for the new dashboard
* Add the new FND function to ECC Personalization Template to view the dashboard



### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Completed all previous labs successfully

## Task 1: ECC Personalization Template for ECC Procurement

In the previous task we extended the existing Agreements dashboard to include Local agreements, but this new dashboard is not accessible for end users, its only accessible to the admin who created the dashboard. To make this dashboard accessible we would ideally create an OA page which requires a lot of development effort. The other way to make the dashboard accessible to users is to leverage the ECC Personalization Template feature.

ECC Personalization Template is a seeded OA page shipped as part of ECC Developer responsibility i.e., seeded FND function FND\_ECC\_SCRATCHPAD where customers can easily add and remove tabs within this seeded OA page. This allows user to access and manage multiple dashboards from a single responsibility so that they can have a full view of all business operations. This is different from using menus i.e., creating a menu hierarchy to personalize existing dashboards, which needs additional development in terms of creating OA pages, rather the ECC Personalization Template approach is a much easier approach in personalizing and extending not just a single dashboard but across multiple dashboards. No developer is needed in developing an OA page

With this feature users can:

1. Structure cross departmental dashboards access
2. Create new command centers
3. Create single menu entry
4. Add new dashboards to existing dashboards

**Goal:** In this task our goal is to provide Local Agreements dashboard access to the users who have access to Purchasing, Vision Operations responsibility
