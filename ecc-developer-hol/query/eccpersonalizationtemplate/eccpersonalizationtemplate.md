## Task 1: ECC Personalization Template for ECC Procurement

In Lab 5 we extended the existing Agreements dashboard to include Local agreements. To make this dashboard accessible we would ideally create an OA page which requires a lot of development effort. The other way to make the dashboard accessible to users is to leverage the ECC Personalization Template feature.

ECC Personalization Template is a seeded OA page shipped as part of ECC Developer responsibility i.e., seeded FND function FND\_ECC\_PERSONALIZE\_TEMPLATE where customers can easily add and remove tabs within this seeded OA page. This allows user to access and manage multiple dashboards from a single responsibility so that they can have a full view of all business operations. This is different from using menus i.e., creating a menu hierarchy to personalize existing dashboards, which needs additional development in terms of creating OA pages, rather the ECC Personalization Template approach is a much easier approach in personalizing and extending not just a single dashboard but across multiple dashboards. No developer is needed in developing an OA page

With this feature users can:

1. Structure cross departmental dashboards access
2. Create new command centers
3. Create single menu entry
4. Add new dashboards to existing dashboards

**Goal:** In this task our goal is to provide Local Agreements dashboard access to the users who have access to Purchasing, Vision Operations responsibility
