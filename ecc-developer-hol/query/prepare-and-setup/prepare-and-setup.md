# Prepare and Set up compute instance


## Introduction

This lab is optional and is only required if you want to run this workshop on your own tenancy.

This Lab will show you how to download the Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) stack zip file needed to setup the resource needed to run this workshop and will show you how to set up a Resource Manager stack that will generate the Oracle Cloud objects needed to run your workshop. 

Estimated Time: 25 minutes

### Objectives
-   Download ORM stack
-   Create Compute + Networking using Resource Manager Stack
-   Connect to compute instance


### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- An Oracle Free Tier or Paid Cloud account
- SSH Keys
## Task 1: Download Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) stack zip file
1.  Click on the link below to download the Resource Manager zip file you need to build your environment: [ebs-eccv10-mkplc.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecchol/Oracle/my-new-branch/ebs-eccv10-mkplc.zip)

  ![Enter main configurations](../images/hq6.png " ")

    - **Instance Count:** Accept the default, **1**, unless you intend to create more than one (e.g. for a team)
    - **Select Availability Domain:** Select an availability domain from the dropdown list.
    - **Need Remote Access via SSH?** In this step you have 3 options. We recommend you to proceed with **Option (B)**.
        - **Option (A)** - Keep Unchecked for Remote Desktop only Access - The Default
        - **Option (B)** - Check *Need Remote Access via SSH?* and keep *Auto Generate SSH Key Pair* unchecked to enable remote access via SSH protocol, then provide the SSH public key(s).

            - **SSH Public Key**: Select *Choose SSH Key Files*
                - *Choose Public Key Files*: Drag-n-drop or browse and select  public key *ecchol.pub* from this directory ecc-hol-keys which can be extratced from after downloading this  [ecc-hol-keys.zip](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles/ecc-hol-keys.zip) on your computer

        ![Choose SSH keys](../images/hq2.png " ")

        >**Notes:**
        1. This assumes that you already have an SSH key pair available on the local system where you will be connecting from. If you don't and for more info on creating and using SSH keys for your specific platform and client, please refer to the guide [Generate SSH Keys](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/labs/generate-ssh-key)
        2. If you used the Oracle Cloud Shell to create your key, make sure you paste the pub file in a notepad, and remove any hard returns. The file should be one line or you will not be able to login to your compute instance

        - **Option (C)** - Check *Need Remote Access via SSH?* and *Auto Generate SSH Key Pair* to have the keys auto-generated for you during provisioning. If you select this option you will be provided with the private key post provisioning.

        ![Auto-generate SSH keys](../images/hq3.png " ")

    Depending on the quota you have in your tenancy you can choose from standard Compute shapes or Flex shapes. Please visit the Appendix: Troubleshooting Tips for instructions on checking your quota

    

    - **Use Flexible Instance Shape with Adjustable OCPU Count?:** Unchecked
    - **Instance Shape:** Accept the default shown or select from the dropdown. e.g. VM.Standard2.2

  ![Use fixed shapes](../images/fixed-shape.png " ")

6. For this section we will provision a new VCN with all the appropriate ingress and egress rules needed to run this workshop.  
    - **Use Existing VCN?:** Accept the default by leaving this unchecked. This will create a **new VCN**.

7. Click **Next**.
8. Select **Run Apply** and click **Create**.

  ![Run Apply](../images/run-apply.png " ")

9. Your stack has now been created and the *Apply* action triggered is running to deploy your environment!

  ![Apply is successful](../images/hq7.png " ")



## Task 5: Access the Graphical Remote Desktop
For ease of execution of this workshop, your VM instance has been pre-configured with a remote graphical desktop accessible using any modern browser on your laptop or workstation. Proceed as detailed below to log in.

1. Navigate to **Stack Details** -> **Application Information** tab, and click the **Remote Desktop** URL.

  ![Click Remote Desktop URL](../images/ebseccoci.png " ")

  ![URL opens](../images/novnc-login-ssh.png " ")

  This should take you directly to your remote desktop in a single click.

  ![Remote desktop displayed](../images/novnc-launch-get-started.png " ")

  If you see the below error, we recommend to bounce EBS services, follow below steps:
  ![Click Remote Desktop URL](../images/servicedown.png " ")
  a. Open the terminal and source EBS apps running instance, by using below command  
      ```text
    <copy>
    source /u01/install/APPS/EBSapps.env run
    </copy>
    ```

  b. Stop the EBS services: 
    - Navigate to $ADMIN\_SCRIPTS\_HOME
      ```text
      <copy>
      cd $ADMIN_SCRIPTS_HOME
      </copy>
      ```
    - Stop all EBS services using below command
      ```text
      <copy>
      ./adstpall.sh
      </copy>
      ```
    - Use below passwords when prompted:
        - APPS Username: **apps**
        - APPS Password: **apps**
        - Weblogic Server Password: **welcome1**

  ![Click Remote Desktop URL](../images/stopall.png " ")

  c. Now, start the EBS services:
    - Navigate to $ADMIN\_SCRIPTS\_HOME
      ```text
      <copy>
      cd $ADMIN_SCRIPTS_HOME
      </copy>
      ```
    - Start all EBS services using below command
      ```text
      <copy>
      ./adstrtal.sh
      </copy>
      ```
    - Use below passwords when prompted:
        - APPS Username: **apps**
        - APPS Password: **apps**
        - Weblogic Server Password: **welcome1**

  ![Click Remote Desktop URL](../images/startall.png " ")

    >**Note:** While rare, you may see an error on the browser - “*Deceptive Site Ahead*” or similar depending on your browser type as shown below.

    Public IP addresses used for LiveLabs provisioning come from a pool of reusable addresses and this error is because the address was previously used by a compute instance long terminated, but that wasn't properly secured, got bridged, and was flagged. You can safely ignore and proceed by clicking on *Details*, and finally, on *Visit this unsafe site*.

  ![Deceptive error](../images/novnc-deceptive-site-error.png " ")

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.

## Appendix 1:  Use Auto-generated SSH Keys to Connect to Your Instance via an SSH Terminal

If you elected to auto-generate the SSH key pair at provisioning, proceed as indicated below.

In this example, we will be illustrating a connection from a Unix-style terminal such as *Mobaxterm*, MacOS terminal, etc.. For *Putty* on Windows, please refer to the guide [Generate SSH Keys](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/labs/generate-ssh-key) on how to convert the key to the required *.ppk* format.

1. Click *Copy* to get the private key and paste it into a file on the system with an SSH client where you intend to initiate the connection. e.g. *mykey_rsa*.

    ![Copy private key](../images/copy-private-key.png " ")

2. Restrict the permissions on the file to *0600*

    ```text
    <copy>
    chmod 600 mykey_rsa
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Restrict permission to file](../images/chmod.png " ")

3. Connect to your instance using the key.

    ```text
    <copy>
    ssh -i <path to mykey_rsa> opc@<my instance public IP>
    </copy>
    ```
    ![SSH connect to instance](../images/ssh-login.png " ")

## Appendix 2:  Terraform and Resource Manager
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.  Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter.  In this lab, a configuration file has been created for you to build a network and compute components.  The compute component you will build creates an image out of Oracle's Cloud Marketplace.  This image is running Oracle Linux 7.

Resource Manager is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service that allows you to automate the process of provisioning your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Using Terraform, Resource Manager helps you install, configure, and manage resources through the "infrastructure-as-code" model. To learn more about OCI Resource Manager, watch the video below.
