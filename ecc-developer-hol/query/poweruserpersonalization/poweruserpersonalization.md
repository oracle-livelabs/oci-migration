## Task 1: ECC Component walkthroughs

**Categorization of components**

Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework UI components are grouped into four main groups:
   * Navigation:
      * Search Box
      * Selected Refinements (breadcrumb)
      * Available Refinements
   * Visualization: 
      * Summarization Bar
      * Chart
      * Tag Cloud Aggregated Table
      * Diagram
      * Aggregated Grid
   * Detailed insights:    
      * Results Table
      * Results Grid
   * Layout:
      * Tabbed component container

   All Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework components come with a unified configuration model that enhances the configuration experience. Also, many components share a subset of user-facing options. 


**Configuration model**


   The Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework configuration model uses a familiar structure that follows that of a SQL query. No coding or custom expressions are required to configure any Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework component.
   For the sake of explaining different configuration options of Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework components, we will use a SQL query structure to introduce the relevant concept in the Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework configuration template. Please note that Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework does not execute a SQL query to display data in a component.


   For example, given the SQL query:

      SELECT
      SUM(ASSET_COST), MAJOR_CATEGORY

   The metric can be added under "Metrics" with the Attribute of "Asset Cost" and Aggregation "Sum".
    ![Configuration model](../images/conf1.png "Configuration model")
   
   If the SQL statement is:

      FROM
      fa-asset
   The Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework Configuration would show
   fa_asset as the selected data set.
    ![Configuration model](../images/conf2.png "Configuration model")

   If the SQL statement is:
      WHERE
      ASSET\_TYPE = 'CAPITALIZED'
   The Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework Configuration would have the condition with Asset Type Code for Attribute, = for Operator, and CAPITALIZED for Value.
    ![Configuration model](../images/conf3.png "Configuration model")
   If the SQL statement is:
      GROUP BY MAJOR\_CATEGORY
   The Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework Configuration would have
   The category listed under Dimensions
    ![Configuration model](../images/conf4.png "Configuration model")
   If the SQL statement is:
      HAVING
      SUM(ASSET\_COST) > 10000
   The Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework Configuration would have Asset Cost (SUM) for Attribute, >= for Operator, and 10000 for Value under Aggregate Conditions.
    ![Configuration model](../images/conf5.png "Configuration model")


   Based on the above example, the following chart will be displayed:
    ![Configuration model](../images/conf6.png "Configuration model")
   Likewise a Results Table, which is a flat list of rows, displaying Batch name, Journal name, Account type, Source, Category from  attributes would be similar to a translate to 
      Select Batch name, Journal name, Account type, Source, Category from table name



## Task 2: Personalize Supplier Balance Dashboard

**Goal**: As a Payables Accountant, I want to track  cash outflow for invoice payments per bank account so that I can analyze payment trends 


1. Login to EBS apps (Navigate to http://apps.example.com:8000) with below credentials

   ![Enable Personalization Mode](../images/sup5.png "Enable Personalization Mode")



11. Add a new Tab in the existing Tab component. To do this you need to click on the configuration icon for the existing Tab component and then add a new Tab in it. Name this tab "Bank Balance"

   ![Configure Tab layout](../images/sup9.png "Configure Tab layout")

12. Click "Preview" and then click "Save"
   ![Save Tab component](../images/sup10.png "Save Tab component")

13. Add a chart component inside the new tab "Bank Balance" to highlight paid amount per bank account

    - Data set: Payments 
    - Chart type: Bar
    - Dimension: Bank Account (series dimension)
    - Metric: Attribute (Paid amount) and Aggregation (Sum) 

14. Click preview 
15. This gives cash outflow across all currencies, now add additional dimension to split the chart per currency.

16. Add "Currency" as Trellis column dimension
17. Click "Preview" and then click "Save"

   ![Add Trellis column](../images/sup120.png "Add Trellis column")
   ![Save trellis chart](../images/sup13.png "Save trellis chart")


18. In addition of viewing detailed payments add a Pivot view under "Bank Balances" tab.

19. Add New Component- Aggregate Table (Pivot view is an alternate visualization of the Aggregate Table component)
    - Data set: Payments
    - Attributes:
          - Supplier name
          - Supplier site
          - Currency name (This will become a column when Pivot visualization is enabled)
    - Metric:
          - Attribute (Paid amount) and Aggregation (Sum)
20. Click preview. This gives Per supplier, per supplier site totals of invoice paid amount.

    ![Aggregate table configuration](../images/sup140.png "Aggregate table configuration")

22. Save the configuration


    ![Save Aggregate table configuration](../images/sup160.png "Save Aggregate table configuration")
