#  Installation


### Introduction


This lab walks you through the steps to install and set up Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework. In this workshop Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework is already installed and set up for you to use. Therefore, this lab is optional. 

Estimated Time: 45 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:

* Validate if EBS responsibility tree is up and validate if EBS run edition can be sourced
* Extract quickInstall
* Create ECC schema and install Weblogic Server
* Create and validate ECC domain and Validate ECC Release
* Register ECC Instance as FND Node and Create EBS JNDI and Validate EBS JNDI
* Integrate ECC with EBS instance and Integrate EBS with ECC
* Import ECC applications and Run dataload


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Completed the previous lab successfully 

##  

## Task 1: Extract Quick Install and Create ECC Schema

1. From the browser, open chrome and from the address bar navigate to http://apps.example.com:8000 

    ```
  	 <copy>http://apps.example.com:8000 </copy>
    ```




2. Login with following credentials:


    ```
  	 Username= eccadmin
Password= welcome1
    ```


3. Verify if EBS homepage is displayed, like in below image:
    ![Login to EBS](../images/verify1.png "EBS login")
4. Ensure if the responsibility tree is up, like shown in below image:

    ![View EBS responsibility tree](../images/verify2.png "EBS responsibility tree")

**Note:** If you are not able to type in the remote desktop, then please hit the command key

5. Open a terminal window for EBS to,<n> Source EBS edition</n>. Type the following command (case is important) in the terminal :

    ```
  	 <copy>source /u01/install/APPS/EBSapps.env run</copy>
    ```


6. In the image below, you can see how you should source the running EBS edition on the terminal.
    ![Source Run edition in EBS](../images/validateterminal1.png "Source run edition" )

7. Now open a new terminal for ECC, leave the previous EBS terminal open. Within the ECC terminal, navigate to /u01 directory by using below command

    ```
  	 <copy>cd /u01</copy>
    ```



8. .bsx files are downloaded in /u01 directory. Extract the .bsx files by running the below command from /u01 directory 


    ```
  	 <copy>for f in *.bsx; do sh $f; done</copy>
    ```


    ![Extract quickInstall](../images/quickinstall.png "Extract quickInstall")

9. This process will take a few minutes. After extraction is completed, navigate to cd /u01/Oracle/quickInstall

    ```
  	 <copy>cd /u01/Oracle/quickInstall</copy>
    ```



**Note:** In this directory (Oracle/quickInstall) there is a file called "EccConfig.properties", which has all the parameters predefined for this Hands-on-lab.

10. From the ECC terminal make sure that you are in  /u01/Oracle/quickInstall directory and then execute the below script. When prompted choose **Option 1** to create ECC schema. 

    ```
  	 <copy>./envSetup.sh</copy>
    ```
    ![Select Option 1](../images/selectoption.png "Select Option 1")

11. This step creates the ECC schema and provides an option to use the existing ECC user created in the ECC database:


    ```
  	 Selected ECC DB is jdbc:oracle:thin:@ebs.org:1521:ebsdb
Is the user <ECC_DB_USERNAME> existing in ECC database [y/n]?<password>
    ```


12. If you choose option “y”, you are prompted for ECC user credentials to create the ECC schema. If you choose the option “n”, you are prompted to enter ECC database system user credentials to create the ECC user and later create the ECC schema. For this demo type **"n"**

13. When prompted provide the database system user details, mentioned below:

    ```
  	 Database system username: system
Database system password: manager
Password for ECC DB user: welcome1
Confirm Password for ECC DB user: welcome1
    ```
14. You will see the below screen

    ![Enter database credentials](../images/eccschema0.png "Enter database credentials")


15. **Option 1** should be completed successfully. You can verify the logs in $ECC_BASE/Oracle/quickInstall/logs/setup.log

16. Enter **Option 6** to exit and then execute following commands to validate  successful ECC schema creation:

    ```
  	 <copy> source env/ecc.env </copy>
    ```

17. Execute the following command with the credentials mentioned:


    ```
  	 <copy>sqlplus $ECC_DB_USER@"(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=$ECC_HOST_NAME)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=$EBS_DS_NAME)))"</copy>
    ```
    ```
  	 <copy>Password:welcome1</copy>
    ```



    ![Validate ECC dB Connection](../images/systemmanager1.png "Validate ECC dB Connection")

    ![No data visible in dashboard](../images/eccuser2.png "No data visible in dashboard")

Each product with an Enterprise Command Center provides a concurrent program to load its product-specific data into the Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework installation. 

Here we will take the example of Oracle Payables with the respective Data Load Concurrent Program "Payables Command Center Data Load".Run this program now to perform an initial full load. 

You should also schedule the data load programs periodically to perform incremental loads to update the data available in the Enterprise Command Center dashboards. For details, see your product documentation.
 
### Execution Flow

23. The following diagram gives an overview of a Data load process:
    ![Data load techincal overview](../images/dataload.png "Data load techincal overview")


Jobs should be submitted from EBS concurrent program and hence the tracking should be exposed to the concurrent program job.
Concurrent program keeps polling the status of the job from ECC and display the current status of the job

24. Login in EBS (From the browser navigate to http://apps.example.com:8000) using below credentials:

    ```
  	 Username: eccuser
Password: welcome1
    ```


25. Once you login, navigate to "Payables Manager" and then to "Payables Command Center"


    ![Go to Payables Command Center](../images/validateeccuser.png "Go to Payables Command Center")

26. Change the function id to **1011696** in the url as indicated in the image below and hit enter

    ![Change function ID](../images/eccuser3.png "Change function ID")

27. You will see the below "Schedule request" page 

    ![Schedule request](../images/eccuser4.png "Schedule request")




28. Choose "Payables Command Center Data Load" in the Program name by copying it from below and pasting in the Program Name

    ```
  	 <copy>Payables Command Center Data Load</copy>
    ```

    ![Enter parameters](../images/ipl2.png "Enter parameters")
31. Click "Submit"
    ![Click submit](../images/ipl3.png "Click submit")
32. You should see the below screen once the data load is successful

    ![Successful data load message](../images/ipl4.png "Successful data load message")
33. You can track the dataload 
    ![Track dataload in EBS](../images/ipl5.png "Track dataload in EBS")
34. Or You can also track the dataload by copying the Concurrent Program ID then navigating to ECC Developer i.e., (Navigating to http://apps.example.com:8000/ecc) and then to Data Load Tracking Page using admin credentials provided below:


    ```
  	 Username: eccadmin
Password: welcome1
    ```


35. You can check the respective job using the Concurrent Program ID, as shown in below image

    ![Track dataload in ECC](../images/ipl6.png "Track dataload in ECC")


36. From ECC:
    - User can check details for each query in real time.
    - It reflects the current load status: Number of successful rows and number of failed rows.
    - It shows when the query started, how much time spent at the DB, the sql text and the operation.
    - User can cancel the running job

    SQL Trace can be enabled by passing “TRUE” value while starting the data load Concurrent Program.
    The trace log file will be generated with the ECC Data Load sub-request “Job ID” as the identifier. The “Job ID” is noted in the log file of sub-request.

37. Data Load job structure request:
    - One “Audit Request” per job
    - One “Dataset Key” per dataset included at the job
    - One “Audit Load Rule” per load rule for each “Audit Dataset”
    - One “Audit Load Detail” for each query retrieved from the load rule for each “Audit Load Rule”


38. The following image describes Self Job Concurrency Matrix

    ![Self Job Concurrency Matrix](../images/matrix.png "Self Job Concurrency Matrix") 

For details on Data load tuning, ETL Job parameters, SQL Plan statistics and common issues please refer to the [Enterprise Command Center- Installation Guide](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=264801675930013&id=2495053.1&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=1c6rxqpyoj_102)

39. Open the browser and navigate to http://apps.example.com:8000 from eccuser
