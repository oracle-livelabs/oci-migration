##  

## Task 1: Admin user extensibility

**Goal:** As a buyer I want to see the bigger picture of procurement function by means of high level metrics and charts that should help me improve the overall procure to pay process.

1. Login to EBS apps (From the browser URL navigate to http://apps.example.com:8000) with below credentials

    ```
  	 Username: sysadmin
Password: welcome1
    ```

2. Navigate to ECC Developer -> ECC Developer
    ![Procurement Command Center](../images/ext1.png "Procurement Command Center")
3. Search for "Indirect procurement" on the home page, this should filter Procurement application. You will see the below image
    ![Procurement Command Center](../images/ext2.png "Procurement Command Center")
4. Click on the copy page icon for "Indirect procurement"  dashboard, highlighted below
    ![Procurement Command Center](../images/ext3.png "Procurement Command Center")

5. The new page will be copied within the same application. Click on the edit icon to edit this new page
    ![Procurement Command Center](../images/ext4.png "Procurement Command Center")
6. Prefix the page name and page short name with xx and XX respectively, remove the trailing "(1)" as shown in below image and click on "Save"
     ![Procurement Command Center](../images/ext5.png "Procurement Command Center")

7. Search for "Indirect procurement" on the home page again and click on the page we just copied and renamed to open the page
    ![Procurement Command Center](../images/image49.png "Procurement Command Center")

8. Add a chart component in the "Spend" tab (under the Summarization bar) to highlight spend amount

    - Chart title: Spend Type
    - Data set: Indirect Procurement 
    - Chart type: Bar
    - Dimension: Spend type (series dimension) and Spend Date Year (Group dimension)
    - Metric: Attribute (Spend amount) and Aggregation (Sum) 

14. Click preview 
     ![Procurement Command Center](../images/ext700.png "Procurement Command Center")
15. Click Save
     ![Procurement Command Center](../images/ext800.png "Procurement Command Center")
This concludes this task, we successfully extended Indirect Procurement dashboard with a new component (Chart) to suit our requirements but we also need to display this extended Indirect procurement dashboard to all users by replacing the shipped dashboard.

            ```
          * Description: 
                             ```
  	    <copy>PO PCC ECC Custom Indirect Procurement Page</copy>

     ![Duplicate Function](../images/b112.png "Duplicate Function")

     * Click on the “Continue” button
     * Change the value for HTML Call to 
                                  ```

## Task 3: EBS OA Personalization 
1. Login to EBS apps (From the browser URL navigate to http://apps.example.com:8000) with below credentials

    ```
  	 Username: operations
Password: welcome1
    ```
1.	Navigate to Purchasing, Vision Operations (USA) -> Procurement Command Center -> Indirect Procurement
          ![Indirect Procurement](../images/b116.png "Indirect Procurement")
2.	Click on EBS Settings icon
3.	Click on “Personalize Page” option
          ![Personalize Page](../images/b117.png "Personalize Page")

4. Personalize the Rich Container:

    * A rich content container is an OA component which is designed to embed/enclose an external content within an OA Framework page. The rich content container component accepts the URL of the rich content, in this case an ECC dashboard.
    This rich content is then enclosed within an iFrame within an OA Framework page. 
    In this case, through Oracle EBS and ECC integration, users are allowed to drill down from Oracle EBS to ECC. The rich container requires an FND function of the ECC dashboard page, which will allow the user to access the respective ECC dashboard inside EBS.
          ![Personalize Rich Container](../images/b118.png "Personalize Rich Container")

5.	Update the below details and click on the “Apply” button
     * Destination Function: 
                                                      ```
  	    <copy>XX_PO_PCC_ECC_IND_PROC</copy>
            ```
          ![Update Rich Container Details](../images/b119.png "Update Rich Container Details")

6. Click on “Return to Application” to access the dashboard
          ![Indirect Procurement Dashboard](../images/b1110.png " Indirect Procurement Dashboard")
