# Creating the Source Oracle E-Business Suite Environment

## Introduction

In this 30-minute tutorial, you will use an image hosted in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to provision an Oracle E-Business Suite 12.2.10 with Oracle Database 12.1.0.2 demonstration instance on a single virtual machine (VM) on OCI.

Create an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute instance (virtual machine) containing the Release 12.2.10 database and application tiers from the provided image. Use this single-node Vision demonstration instance to evaluate and test standard Oracle E-Business Suite functionality, and demonstrate the standard business flows delivered with the applications. Also use it to become familiar with the technology components of Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12.2 and train your users.

The Oracle E-Business Suite 12.2.10 Demo Install Image can be found in the OCI Console Marketplace and also in the OCI Oracle Images list in your tenancy. Instructions for the OCI Console Marketplace are provided in this document.

**Estimated Lab Time:** 30 minutes


### **Objectives**

In this lab, you will:

* Create and configure a Subnet in which to host your source E-Business Suite environment
* Create an Oracle E-Business Suite Instance using an Image from the OCI Marketplace
* Configure and Start the EBS environment 

### **Prerequisites**

* Complete Workshop: [Lift and Shift On-Premises EBS to OCI Workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=672&clear=180&session=5980193088668)
* An SSH key pair
* OCI Tenancy admin privileges
* A Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) which will be associated with the Oracle E-Business Suite Instance (created as a part of the prerequisite workshop)


## Task 1: Create a Subnet for the Source Environment in OCI

Follow these steps to create a subnet for your source EBS environment. This subnet will be located within the Virtual Cloud Network that was created as a part of the **OCI EBS Cloud Manager Lab**.

1. Login to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and navigate to the **Networking** > **Virtual Cloud Networks** tab.

## Task 3: Configure and Start the source E-Business Suite Environment

These steps will walk through the initial configuration of the source EBS instance and then start the application and database servers on the instance. 

1. Connect to the instance using SSH on Terminal (macOS) or using a tool such as PuTTY (Windows). 

    ```
    <copy>
    ssh -i <SSH private key file path> opc@<Public IP Address>
    </copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/12.png " ")

2. Switch to the root user and then run the ``updatehosts.sh`` script. 

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo su
    </copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>
    /u01/install/scripts/updatehosts.sh

    ```

    ![](./images/17.png " ")

  b. Set SYSADMIN password.

    ```
    <copy>
    mkdir -p ~/logs
    cd  ~/logs
    sh /u01/install/APPS/scripts/enableSYSADMIN.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/18.png " ")

    When prompted, enter a new password for the SYSADMIN user. 

  c. Set Demo Users password.

    ```
    <copy>
    cd ~/logs
    /u01/install/APPS/scripts/enableDEMOusers.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/19.png " ")

    When prompted, enter a new password. 

    Note: Do not run this script on a fresh or production environment.

7. Enable HTTP Access.

  From the OCI console, add a security rule to the security list. 

  a. Navigate to **Networking** > **Virtual Cloud Networks**.
  
  b. Select the VCN associated with your instance: **ebshol\_vcn** (make sure you are in **ebshol\_compartment**).
  
  c. Click on the **ebs\_source\_subnet** and then **Security Lists** under Resources.

      ![](./images/20.png " ")

      Select the **Default Security List** that is associated with this subnet.

  ![](./images/22.png " ")

8. Configure Web Entry Point.

  a. Use the script provides to change the default web entry point, which is app.example.com

    ```
    <copy>
    /u01/install/scripts/configwebentry.sh
    </copy>
    ```

  b. When prompted, enter the following values.

    - **Enter the Web Entry Protocol (Eg: https/http):** `http`
    - **Enter the Web Entry Host Name(Eg: public):** `myapps` 
    - **Enter the Web Entry Domain Name:(Eg: example.com):** `example.com`
    - **Enter the Web Entry Port:(Eg: 443/80):** `8000`
    - **Enter the ORACLE_SID:(Eg: EBSDB):** `ebsdb`
    - **Enter the APPS user password:** `apps`

    ![](./images/23.png " ")

    ![](./images/24-1.png " ")

9. Update local hosts file.

  **For Windows users**

      a. Navigate to Notepad in your start menu.

      b. Hover over Notepad, right-click, and select the option **Run as Administrator**.

      c. In Notepad, navigate to ``File > Open``.

      d. Browse to ``C:\\Windows\System32\drivers\etc``

      e. Find the **file hosts**.

      ![](./images/24-2.png " ")

      f. In the hosts file, scroll down to the end of the content.

      g. Add the following entry to the very end of the file: ``<public_ip> myapps.example.com``

      h. Save the file.

  **For Mac users**

      a. Open a Terminal Window.

      b. Enter the following command.

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo vi /etc/hosts
    </copy>
    ```

      This will then require your local computer password to edit the file. Enter and you should see a screen similar to the one shown below.

      c. Type 'i' to edit the file.

      d. Go to the last line and add the following entry as show below: ``<public_ip> myapps.example.com``

      ![](./images/24-3.png " ")

      e. Once you have finished editing the file hit 'esc' and type ':wq' to save and exit.

10. Log on to Applications.

  Returning to the SSH session in Terminal or PuTTY as the Oracle user, run the following script to start the application.

    ```
    <copy>
    /u01/install/APPS/scripts/startapps.sh 
    </copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/25.png " ")

  You can now access the applications using [http://myapps.example.com:8000/OA_HTML/AppsLogin](http://myapps.example.com:8000/OA_HTML/AppsLogin)

      ![](./images/26.png " ")

  Note: If you cannot access the webpage of the EBS environment, you may need to open the firewall on the instance for port 8000. Try accessing the EBS application, and if you cannot reach the webpage, run the following commands on the instance as the opc user (You may need enter 'exit' two times to get back to the opc user). 

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=8000/tcp
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    </copy>
    ```

11. Acknowledge the secure configuration recommendations.

  Access to the environment will be restricted until the system administrator configures or acknowledges the secure configuration recommendations.

  To access the Secure Configuration Console, a user must have a responsibility that includes the Applications System (OAM\_APP\_SYSTEM) function privilege, such as the seeded System Administration or System Administrator responsibilities, and must be registered as a local user with Oracle E-Business Suite. The administrator must log in to Oracle E-Business Suite using the local login page (http(s)://[host]:[port]/OA_HTML/AppsLocalLogin.jsp) to navigate to the console and unlock the system. If a user with local system administrator privileges is not available, you can access the Secure Configuration Console through a command line utility. For more information, see "Secure Configuration Console" in the Oracle E-Business Suite Security Guide.

  Note: Once the system is "Unlocked" for normal usage, the Secure Configuration Console is still available for administrators under the 'Functional Administrator' responsibility.
