# Set Up the Landing Zone

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to deploy a Terraform-based landing zone template to your tenancy. This template meets the security guidance prescribed in the CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark and fulfills Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS)-specific workload requirements.

Estimated Lab Time: 25 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace Stacks

We will be using resource manager stacks available on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Marketplace to deliver the templates. In this lab, we will deploy *Oracle E-Business Suite: Tenancy Admin Stack for Landing Zones* and *Oracle E-Business Suite: Network Admin Stack for Landing Zones*.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Set up a compartments structure, administrative groups, and policies that make up the landing zone foundation.
* Set up the network required to deploy EBS workloads and EBS Cloud Manager.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle Cloud account 

## Task 1: Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console

Use the tenancy administrator credentials to sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Console.

1. Reference your `key-data.txt` file and locate the tenancy administrator credentials.

2. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console using the following:

    * **User name**: `Tenancy Admin Username`
    * **Password**: `Tenancy Admin Password`

## Task 2: Create the Foundation

In this task, we will create the compartments, management groups, and policies that make up the foundation for the CIS OCI Foundations Benchmark.

The following diagram depicts the compartment distribution, which includes the application compartment for EBS workloads with subcompartments corresponding to environment categories (such as test or production).

1. In the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Console navigation menu, under **Marketplace**, select **All Applications**.

2. From the Marketplace applications page:

    a. Navigate to **Filters**, then **Type**, and select **Stack**.

    b. In the search bar, enter `E-Business Landing Zone`.

    c. Click the application **Oracle E-Business Suite: Tenancy Admin Stack for Landing Zones**.

    ![This is Oracle E-Business Suite: Tenancy Admin Stack for Landing Zones in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace.](images/marketplace-lz-stacks-tenancy.png)

    d. In the **Version** drop-down list, ensure the default is selected. 
    
    e. In the **Compartment** drop-down list, select the root compartment.

    f. Review and accept the Terms of Use.

    g. Click **Launch Stack**.

    ![This is the launch page for the Oracle E-Business Suite: Network Admin Stack for Landing Zones.](images/mktpl-tenancy-admin-stack-lz.png)

3. On the Stack information screen, enter the following values:

    a. **Name**: Default name is "Oracle E-Business Suite: Tenancy Admin Stack for Landing Zones-&lt;date&time&gt;".

    b. **Description**: Add a description for the stack.

    c. Click **Next**.

    ![This is the Stack information Screen for the Oracle E-Business Suite: Tenancy Admin Stack for Landing Zones.](images/tenancy-stack-info.png)

4. On the Configure variables screen, enter the following values:

    a. **Landing Zone Prefix**: `ebshol`

    b. **Parent Compartment**: Select your root compartment as the parent compartment for your resources.

    c. **EBS workload environment categories**: In this field, enter *Production* and *QA* to add these categories.

    d. Click **Next**.

    ![This is the Configure variables screen for the Oracle E-Business Suite: Tenancy Admin Stack for Landing Zones.](images/tenancy-stack-config-variables.png)

5. On the Review screen, ensure the **Run apply** checkbox is selected. Verify the information and click **Create**.

    ![This is the Review screen for the Oracle E-Business Suite: Tenancy Admin Stack for Landing Zones.](images/tenancy-stack-review.png)

    Note that if you receive the following error while creating this stack, you must click on the "Stack Details" link at the top of the page. From there, click **Apply** and in the window that appears, click **Apply** again to rerun the stack.

    ``dial tcp: lookup <xxxxxxxxxxxxx>-management.kms.<region>>.oraclecloud.com on XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:XX: no such host``

## Task 3: Create the Network

This task guides you through the process of running the network stack, which will allow you to define a VCN, subnets to support EBS Cloud Manager deployment, as well as the subnets for the first environment category. Additionally, you will configure security rules, and deploy gateways required to support a secured EBS workload deployment. 

The following diagram depicts a virtual cloud network with all subnets required for running EBS workloads and EBS Cloud Manager. The network stack can be deployed multiple times, one for each environment category.

2. From the Marketplace applications page:

    a. Navigate to **Filters**, then **Type**, and select **Stack**.

    b. In the search bar, enter `E-Business Landing Zone`.

    c. Click the application **Oracle E-Business Suite: Network Admin Stack for Landing Zones**.
