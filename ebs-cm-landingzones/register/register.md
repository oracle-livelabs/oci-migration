# Register Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager as a Confidential Application

## Introduction

In this lab, you will set up Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager authentication.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### About Oracle Identity and Access Management (IAM) Identity Domains
In this lab, we will be showcasing how Oracle Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity domains can be used to manage single sign-on authentication. Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager uses IAM identity domains to manage user authentication.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Register Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager as a confidential application in your Default identity domain.

### Prerequisites

* The procedure described in this lab is to be performed by the tenancy administrator.

## Task 1: Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console

Use the tenancy administrator credentials to sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Console.

1. Reference your `key-data.txt` file and locate the tenancy administrator credentials.

2. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console using the following:

    * **User name**: `Tenancy Admin Username`
    * **Password**: `Tenancy Admin Password`

## Task 2: Register Cloud Manager as a Confidential Application in Tenancies Using IAM with Identity Domains

1. Open the navigation menu and click **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity**, click **Domains**.

    ![This screenshot shows the console navigation menu and depicts the navigation to the Domains page.](./images/domains-navigation.png " ")

2. Select the root compartment in the **Compartment** drop-down list.

3. Within the list of domains, click the link for the "Default" domain.

    ![This screenshot shows the Domains page.](./images/domains-listing.png " ")

4. Under the Domain Information tab, record your Domain URL for future reference. 

    a. Click the "Copy" link next to the Domain URL value. 
    
    b. Paste this into the `key-data.txt` file and remove the port portion of the URL (for example ":443").

5. Click **Integrated applications** in the menu on the left. 

    ![This screenshot shows the Integrated applications page and highlights the Add application button within the user interface.](./images/integrated-applications.png " ")

6. Click **Add application**.

7. Select **Confidential Application**. 

    ![This screenshot shows the Add application window and highlights the Confidential Application option.](./images/confidential-application.png " ")

8. Click **Launch Workflow**. This takes you to the Add Confidential Application page.

9. Under Add application details, enter the following:
    - **Name**: `Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager`
    - **Description**: Enter a description.

10. Click **Next**.

11. Under Configure OAuth:

    a. Click **Configure this application as a client now**.
    
    b. Under Allowed grant types, select the checkboxes for the following options:
    - **Client credentials**
    - **Refresh token**
    - **Authorization code**

    c. Now, we are going to set our Cloud Manager URL. For this lab, use the following example URL: `https://myebscm.ebshol.org:443`

      Save your Cloud Manager URL in your `key-data.txt` file as `Cloud_Manager_URL`.

      Using the Cloud Manager URL you have just saved, append that URL with the following values as shown to enter your Redirect URL.

    d. **Redirect URL**: `<Cloud Manager URL>/cm/auth/callback`
    
    For example: `https://myebscm.ebshol.org:443/cm/auth/callback`

    e. **Post-logout redirect URL**: `<Cloud Manager URL>/cm/ui/index.html?root=login`
    
    For example: `https://myebscm.ebshol.org:443/cm/ui/index.html?root=login`

    f. **Logout URL**: Leave this field empty.

It highlights the Client credentials, Refresh token, and Authorization code options which must be selected. It also highlights the Redirect URL and Post-logout redirect URL which must be entered. Note that it is required that the Logout URL field is left empty.](./images/client-configuration-1.png " ")

    g. Under Client Type, ensure that the **Confidential** radio button is selected.

     1. Click **Add roles**.
     
        ![This screenshot shows the Configure OAuth section when adding an application and highlights the Add app roles check box which must be selected and the Add roles button in the user interface.](./images/client-configuration-3.png " ")
     
     2. Select **Authenticator Client** and **Me**. Then click **Add**.
     
        ![This screenshot shows the Add app roles section and highlights the Me and Authenticator Client check boxes to be selected. It also points out the Add button on the user interface.](./images/add-app-roles.png " ")
    
    3. Click **Next**.
    
12. Under Configure policy, click **Finish**.

    ![This screenshot shows the Finish button within the user interface in the Configure policy section.](./images/configure-policy.png " ")

13. Under the General Information section, make a note of the following values in your `key-data.txt` file:

    • **Client ID**

    • **Client secret** (In order to view, click the "Show secret" link.)

    ![This screenshot shows the confidential application information page.](./images/client-id-and-secret.png " ")

14. Click **Activate** and confirm to activate the confidential application.
