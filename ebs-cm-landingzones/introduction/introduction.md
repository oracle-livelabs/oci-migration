# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will first establish a pre-defined landing zone that: 
* Meets the security guidelines prescribed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, and 
* Supports Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) workloads. 

Note that this landing zone is comprised of compartments, groups to manage those compartments, and a fully configured network. 

After deploying the landing zone, you will install and configure EBS Cloud Manager, which can utilize the resources from the landing zone to manage your EBS environments. Once this is completed, you will be able to provision your first EBS environment. 

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours

Note the following:
* This workshop is quite detailed and technical. PLEASE take your time and DO NOT skip any steps.
* IP addresses and URLs in the screenshots found in this procedure may differ from what you use in the labs as these are dynamically generated. 
* For security purposes, some sensitive text (such as IP addresses) may be redacted in the screenshots in this procedure.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
* Set up the landing zone
* Deploy and configure Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager

### Prerequisites

The following expertise is beneficial:
* Knowledge of how to connect to virtual machines from your local machine (such as Putty or SSH)
* Knowledge of Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS)
* Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) domains

    * User-generated, using Resource Manager and the provided Terraform script
* Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager Compute instance
    * User-provisioned using Oracle Marketplace image
    * Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager application
    * EBS sandbox network deployment script
* Oracle E-Business Suite environment 1 Compute instance
    * User provisioned environment
    * Application and database tiers on this compute instance
* Oracle E-Business Suite environment 2 Compute instance
    * Cloned from environment 1
    * Application and database tiers on this compute instance

| What          |      How      |  Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Lab 1**: Get Started | Download `key-data.txt`, establish Oracle Cloud account | You will use the `key-data.txt` file to record information that you will use throughout the workshop. |
| **Lab 2**: Set Up the Landing Zone | Create the foundation; Create the network | Run the EBS Tenancy Admin Stack for Landing Zones and EBS Network Admin Stack for Landing Zones to create the compartment distribution and network. |
| **Lab 3**: Register EBS Cloud Manager as a Confidential Application | Register EBS Cloud Manager as a confidential application in tenancies using IAM with identity domains | Configure EBS Cloud Manager authentication using IAM with identity domains. |
| **Lab 4**: Deploy and Configure EBS Cloud Manager | Deploy and configure EBS Cloud Manager and required resources| Use the EBS Cloud Manager Deployment Stack for Landing Zones to deploy the Cloud Manager Compute instance and configure the web application. |
<!--| **Lab 5**: Provision your EBS environment | Use One-Click Provisioning to create and configure your first EBS environment | Provision an environment using One-Click Provisioning; Enable and set EBS account passwords; Open firewall and security list to allow connections to EBS environment; Configure local hosts file and log in to EBS. |-->
