### Introduction to Oracle Enterprise Command Center

Enterprise Command Centers (ECC) provide information discovery along with visualization and exploration capabilities embedded within Oracle E-Business Suite user interfaces. Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework enables the creation of business dashboards in different functional areas.

Oracle E-Business Suite users navigate transactional information using interactive visual components and guided discovery capabilities allowing exploratory data analysis. Mobility and responsive design are built into the Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework, and all dashboards automatically adjust the layout to better fit a desktop or mobile device form factor. Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework automatically adheres to existing Oracle E-Business Suite security. The dashboard content a user sees is completely consistent with the Oracle E-Business Suite context and security.
