### Introduction


In ECC, Power users can modify a dashboard to tailor it based on their business requirements. This lab walks you through the steps to Personalize an existing dashboard to suit it to your business requirement with an example. 

Estimated Time: 20 minutes


A Power User has:

*	Same designer experience as admin
*	Enabled at the user level using the profile option “FND: ECC Power User Enabled”
*	All personalizations are saved without any deployment. 
*	No access to ECC Admin UI

<h2> A Power user can/can't do the following: </h2>
<div>

<table id="huyh">


  <tr>
    <th>Can</th>
    <th>Cannot</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Adding a new component</td>
    <td>Create a new data set</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Modify existing component</td>
    <td>Create a new dashboard</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    * Data set: Payments
    * Attributes:
         * Supplier name
         * Supplier site

## Task 2: Run dataload for General Ledger Command Center

You have already run dataload for Payables command center. The steps are similar here.

* Login to EBS apps (Navigate to http://apps.example.com:8000) with below credentials


 <pre><span class="hljs-attribute">
 Username: eccuser
 Password: welcome1
 Responsibility: General Ledger Super User


</span></code></pre></li>


* Navigate to "General Ledger Command Center"

* When the dashboard appears change the function id in the dashboard to <b>1011696</b> as done before in the Payables command center.

* By default the dashboard is populated with the oldest period, Jan-07. Replace this period Jan-07 with Apr-23 in selected refinements to view latest data 
  ![Image alt text](images/home1.png)

  <b> Note: </b> If instead you see period Adj-07 then replace it with Apr-23.


* Add another refinement Account type : "Expense", by clicking on expense from the charts


  ![Image alt text](images/home56.png)
