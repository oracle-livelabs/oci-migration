  	 <copy>AP,GL,ONT,FA,WIP</copy>
    ```


    ![Enter products to import](../images/importecc11.png "Enter products to import")
    ![Import Applications from EBS](../images/import1000.png "Import Applications from EBS")

11. You should see the following  screen when you run it successfully

    ![Successful import of applications from EBS to ECC](../images/payables12.png "Successful import")


## Task 2: Validate Import of ECC applications

1. Navigate to http://apps.example.com:8000 in the browser with below credentials 


    ```
  	 Username: SYSADMIN
Password: welcome1
    ```

    
2. Navigate to ECC Developer, you should see new applications as below
    ![Validate import of ECC applications](../images/5apps.png "Validate import of ECC applications")


You may now **proceed to the next lab**
