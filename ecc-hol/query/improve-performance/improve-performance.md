# Improve Performance


### Introduction

This lab walks you through the general steps performed to improve performance in Oracle Enterprise Command Center framework.


Estimated Time: 10 minutes


### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Learn about Dataload Tuning

* Learn about Framework tuning


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Completed all previous labs successfully 


##  

## Task 1: Learn about Dataload Tuning 
**Data Load Tuning**
 
Some system level parameters for ETL for tuning ETL performance:
 1. ir.fullload.threads 

     - The number of threads to handle ETL jobs of type "pull" that are allowed to run concurrently. 
     - The default value for this parameter is the number of available cores in the Oracle Enterprise Command Center     Framework server

 2. ir.job.threads
 
     - The number of ingest threads to serve one ETL job.
     - The default value for this parameter is the number of available cores in the server divided by two


 3. ir.push.threads 
 

     - The number of threads to handle ETL jobs of type "push" that are allowed to run concurrently. 
     - The default value for this parameter is the number of available cores in the Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework server

## Task 2: Learn about Framework Tuning 

1. Disk

     - ECC gives flexibility to mount data storage folder on any disk. 
     - SSD provides high transfer rates and pretty much eliminate the latency problems associated with randomly accessing data


2. Memory

3. Core

      - Adding more cores to the machine will impact both ETL and Query time
