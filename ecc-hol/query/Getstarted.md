## Task 2: Enable Copy/Paste from Local to Remote Desktop

* During the execution of your labs, you may need to copy text from your local PC/Mac to the remote desktop, such as commands from the lab guide. While such direct copy/paste isn't supported as you will realize, you may proceed as indicated below to enable an alternative local-to-remote clipboard with Input Text Field.

1. Click on the small gray tab on the middle-left side of your screen to open the control bar and then, select the clipboard icon

## Task 5: Introduction to ECC (No action required)

<b> Oracle ECC Overview </b>

Enterprise Command Centers (ECC) provide information discovery along with visualization and exploration capabilities embedded within Oracle E-Business Suite user interfaces. Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework enables the creation of business dashboards in different functional areas.

Oracle E-Business Suite users navigate transactional information using interactive visual components and guided discovery capabilities allowing exploratory data analysis. Mobility and responsive design are built into the Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework, and all dashboards automatically adjust the layout to better fit a desktop or mobile device form factor. Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework automatically adheres to existing Oracle E-Business Suite security. The dashboard content a user sees is completely consistent with the Oracle E-Business Suite context and security. 

<b> Example of an Enterprise Command Center Dashboard</b>
