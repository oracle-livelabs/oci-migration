## Task 1: Establish connections in Oracle Integration Cloud

### **Install OIC Connectivity Agent on MySQL**

1. Before moving forward, if provided, please keep handy the information with the wallet file (username and password to an ADW or ATP) and continue to the next step. Otherwise, read the step below:

2. If you do not have this information, please follow the lab guide (Part 1 and Part 2) here [link](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/blob/master/workshops/erp-adw-oac/LabGuide100ProvisionAnADWDatabase.md). Once you complete making an ADW or ATP instance, please download the Wallet file from the console. [More info](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/connect-download-wallet.html#GUID-B06202D2-0597-41AA-9481-3B174F75D4B1)

3. Here, you will establish a connection between our MySQL Database and Oracle Integration Cloud. An Oracle Integration Cloud instance will be provided to you. If you do not have an Oracle Integration Cloud instance, follow instructions from [here](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/integration/doc/creating-oracle-integration-instance.html) and create one.

4. For this lab, you will also need an OIC agent to perform connections to the web app's database. Make one by following the instructions below:

5. Login to your OIC instance. In the left navigation pane, click Integrations, then click Agents.

6. Create a new agent by clicking the button - Create Agent Group. Give the agent name as "oscommerce." And click on Create button.

	![](./images/Agent_1.png "")

7. Next, download the agent zip folder by clicking on Download > Connectivity Agent.

	![](./images/Agent_2.png "")

8. SSH to the OsCommerce primary instance. Create a directory in OsCommerce compute for oic agent. For example - /home/oscommerce/oicagent

9. Secure copy (scp/WinSCP) file from your local computer to the OsCommerce instance by running the following command in a terminal window -

	```
	<copy>
	scp -i /Users/mimehta/Desktop/sshkeybundle/privateKey /Users/mimehta/Desktop/oic_connectivity_agent opc@132.145.167.51:/home/opc/oicagent
	</copy>
	```

10. Unzip oic_connectivity_agent.zip using the command

	```
	<copy>
	unzip oic_connectivity_agent.zip
	</copy>
	```

11. Download [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html) and [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html) agent from the links below and copy it to the OsCommerce compute using scp command as step 4.

	![](./images/Agent_2a.png "")

	![](./images/Agent_2b.png "")

12. Create another directory for Java installation - /home/opc/java.

13. Copy JDK in the /home/opc/java directory and MySQL agent in the directory - /home/oscommerce/oicagent/agenthome/thirdparty/lib folder.

14. Unzip and install JDK on OsCommerce compute by navigating to the Java directory and running the command -

	```
	<copy>
	tar zxvf jdk-8u241-linux-x64.tar.gz
	</copy>
	```

15. Navigate to oicagent and Modify InstallerProfile.cfg file to include the following information:

	```
	oic_URL= https://oic_host:ssl_port

	agent_GROUP_IDENTIFIER= Agent group identifier created on step 2

	oic_USER= non-federated user

	oic_PASSWORD= non-federated password
	```

	![](./images/Agent_3.png "")

16. Now, within the oicagent directory, run the following two commands to set the Java home directory.

	```
	export PATH=/home/opc/java/jdk1.8.0_241/bin:$PATH

	export JAVA_HOME=/home/opc/java/jdk1.8.0_241/

	Run the following command to start the agent -

	nohup java -jar connectivityagent.jar
	```

	![](./images/Agent_4.png "")

### **Establish Connections Between MySQL and OIC**

17. On the Oracle Integration Cloud home page, click on the Menu icon in the top left and click on Integration.

	![](./images/1.png "")

18. When the webpage finishes loading, click on "Connections" and click on create.

	![](./images/2.png "")

19. A new window will load. On the top right, search for "MySQL," and you will be able to select MySQL as your adapter. Click on the "Select" button, and you will be redirected to the "Trigger and Invoke" page.

	![](./images/3.png "")

20. On this page, name your connection. In this lab, you used "MySQL_osCommerce." You can optionally add a description to this connection. For the role, make sure that "Trigger and Invoke" is enabled.

	![](./images/4.png "")


21. On the next page, you will be asked to provide information for Connection Properties, Security, and Agent Group. To edit these, click on their respective Configure button and enter the following information:

	```
	Host: This will be the public IP to your compute instance

	Port: Use port 3306 since this is a MySQL database

	Database Name: oscommerce. This is the database name you used in Lab 2

	Username & Password: Use the credentials that you used in Lab 2
	```

22. Agent Group: In the Oracle Integration Cloud instance, there will be an Agent Group preconfigured for you. Select that one. If there is no agent, access this [link](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/integrations-user/agent-download-and-installation.html#GUID-72491B67-7445-4B52-94FA-CEC8488E0F4A) and follow the steps to install a new agent.

23. Please note: For our OIC instance to communicate with the MySQL database, make sure the agent has write permissions to your MySQL database. Please perform the following steps to do that:

24. In your primary compute instance, go to MySQL console and execute the following command:
Here, IP address is the IP address of your agent

	```
	<copy>
	CREATE USER 'root'@'ip_address' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';
	</copy>
	```
	```
	<copy>
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'ip_address';
	</copy>
	```

	![](./images/5.png "")

### **Establish connection from Oracle ADB and OIC**

25. Creating a connection between an Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Integration Cloud is a very similar process to creating a connection between our MySQL database and OIC.

26. Click on the same create button under the Connections tab and search for your respective Oracle Autonomous Database, either Autonomous Transaction Processing or Autonomous Warehouse.

	![](./images/6.png "")

27. In the next window, you will need to provide your Oracle Database wallet file and its respective credentials. You will need to manually type in the Service Name, either High, Medium, or Low (these are specific to concurrent queries, but for our purposes, it does not matter).

	![](./images/7.png "")

### **Establish an integration between the ADW and MySQL connections**

28. Now that you have connections made in Oracle Integration Cloud for our MySQL and Autonomous Database, you will need to establish an integration with both to communicate with each other. Before making a connection, you have to ensure the target database table exists in ADW. For that, follow the instructions here:

29. On your ADW console home page, click service console

	![](./images/5a.png "")

30. Click SQL Developer Web

	![](./images/5b.png "")

31. In this screen, use your ADW credentials

	![](./images/5c.png "")

32. Use the following code to generate the Products table

	![](./images/5d.png "")

	```
	<copy>
	CREATE TABLE "ADMIN"."PRODUCTS"
	(	"PRODUCTS_ID" VARCHAR2(250 BYTE) COLLATE "USING_NLS_COMP",
		"PRODUCTS_QUANTITY" VARCHAR2(250 BYTE) COLLATE "USING_NLS_COMP",
		"PRODUCTS_MODEL" VARCHAR2(250 BYTE) COLLATE "USING_NLS_COMP",
