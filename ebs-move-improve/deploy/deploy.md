    h. **EBS Cloud Manager Shape**: ``VM.Standard.E2.2``

    i. **EBS Cloud Manager Admin Password**:
      - Note: This password is what will allow you to login to the cloud manager instance that is created and **CAN** be different than the user password for logging into the OCI Console.
      - Add this password to your ``key-data.txt`` file.

    j. **Public Key**:

      1. Use an existing or generate a new ssh key. Paste the public key pair.

      For more information on ssh keys, visit: [Generating an SSH Key Pair](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/compute-iaas/generating_ssh_key/generate_ssh_key.html)

    k. **EBS Cloud Manager Availability Domain**: Choose the availability domain that ends in **-1** from the list.

  ![This screenshot shows the Review section withing the Create Stack page. This screen is where you must verify the information entered to create the stack.](./images/8.png " ")

10. This takes you to the Stack Details page for your newly created stack. You will notice that the job status will cycle through **Accepted**, **In Progress**, and **Succeeded**. This will take some time to complete.

  ![This screenshot is of the Stack Details page of the newly created stack.](./images/9.png " ")

  After the job succeeds, you will have all the network resources (VCN, load balancer, subnets, and so on) required to deploy the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager Compute instance.

11. You will find the details related to the EBS Cloud Manager Instance and Load Balancer at the bottom of your log output as shown below:

  Copy and paste **Private IP**, **Public IP**, **Login URL**, and **LB Public IP** to the equivalent fields in your ``key-data.txt`` file. These variables are needed for the remainder of the procedures in this lab.

  ![This screenshot is of the stack log output, highlighting the private IP, public IP, login URL, and load balacer public IP information that you must note in your key-data.txt file.](./images/11.png " ")

## Task 3: Log in to Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager

Before logging into the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager web application, you need to add the **hostname** in the Login URL to your local computer hosts file.

Follow the instructions below to perform this configuration:

Edit the local ``hosts`` file on your laptop and add an entry.

**For Windows users**

  1. Navigate to Notepad in your start menu.

  2. Hover over Notepad, right-click, and select the option **Run as Administrator**.

  3. In Notepad, navigate to ``File > Open``.

  4. Browse to ``C:\\Windows\System32\drivers\etc``.

  5. Find the file "hosts".

      ![This screenshot depicts the navigation to the hosts file within Windows Explorer. ](./images/12.png " ")

  6. In the hosts file, scroll down to the end of the content.

  7. Add the following entry to the very end of the file: ``<lb_public_ip> myebscm.ebshol.org``

  8. Save the file.

**For Mac users**

  1. Open a Terminal Window.

  2. Enter the following command:

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo vi /etc/hosts
    </copy>
    ```

  This will then require your local computer password to edit the file. Enter the password and you should see a screen similar to the one shown below.

  3. Type 'i' to edit the file.

  4. Go to the last line and add the following entry as show below: ``<lb_public_ip> myebscm.ebshol.org``

  5. Once you have finished editing the file, hit 'esc' and type ':wq' to save and exit.

  ![This screenshot shows how to edit the hosts file on a Mac.](./images/13.png " ")

Type the Login URL generated and documented to your ``key-data.txt`` previously into your browser.

Log into the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager using your IDCS credentials for the EBS Cloud Manager account as documented in your ``key-data.txt`` file.

  Note: It may take some additional time for the load balancer to be properly configured. Sometimes it may take up to 30 minutes or an hour to configure. If you would like to check on the status of the load balancer,  in OCI go to **Networking** > **Load Balancers** and then check the **Overall Heatlh** status. If it is OK, the connection can be established. 

  Note: If your login URL is not working or if your compute instance which contains the Cloud Manager image was ever stopped/turned off you may need to check and see if the application is running. The command for this can be found in the Lab "Optional: Managing the EBS Cloud Manager Virtual Machine."

  Note: Your browser may give you an error when attempting to access the EBS Cloud Manager. If you run into an error using the EBS login URL try using a different browser or an incognito session. If this does not solve the problem, try adding ``:443`` after the url (i.e. ``https://myebscm.ebshol.org:443``).
