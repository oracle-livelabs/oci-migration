# Example Queries

## Introduction

This lab will provide various example queries for you to create your own dashboards and widgets

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Be able to use some sample queries to help familiarize yourself further with valuable query searches

### Prerequisites

* Labs 1-4 Completed
* An Oracle Cloud Environment
* EBS Cloud Manager, EBS 1-Click and Advanced Provisioned Instance, Network - All done in the previous workshop

## Task 1: Sample Audit Queries

1. 'Log Source' = 'OCI Audit Logs' and Status not in ('null') | link Status, 'User Name', Event, Method | stats unique('User Name'), unique(Status), unique(Method), unique(Event), unique(Method) | classify topcount = 300 'Group Duration', Status

  - Name: OCI Audit Anomalus Status Calls

2. ‘Log Source’ = ‘OCI Audit Logs’ and ‘Availability Domain’ != ‘null’ and Method != ‘null’ | stats count(Method) by Method, ‘Availability Domain’

3. 'Log Source' = 'OCI Audit Logs' and Event != 'null' and Method != 'null' | stats count by Event | sort -Count

4. 'Log Source' = 'OCI Audit Logs' and 'OCI Resource Name' not in ('null') and Method != 'null' | stats count(Method) by Method, 'OCI Resource Name'

5. ‘Log Source’ = ‘OCI Audit Logs’ and ‘User Name’ != ‘null’ | timestats count as logrecords by ‘User Name’ | sort -logrecords

6. 'Log Source' = 'OCI Audit Logs' and Event != 'null' and Method != 'null' | stats count(Method) by Method, 'User Name'

7. ‘Log Source’ = ‘OCI Audit Logs’ and ‘User Name’ not in (‘null’, cloudguard) and ‘OCI Resource Name’ != null | stats count by ‘User Name’, ‘OCI Resource Name’

## Task 2: Sample VCN Queries

1. ‘Entity Type’ = ‘OCI VCN Virtual Network Interface Card’ and ‘Log Source’ = ‘OCI VCN Flow Unified Schema Logs’ | stats count by Entity

2. ‘Entity Type’ = ‘OCI VCN Virtual Network Interface Card’ and ‘Log Source’ = ‘OCI VCN Flow Unified Schema Logs’ | eval vol = ‘Content Size Out’ / (1024 * 1024) | stats sum(vol) as ‘Egress (Mb)’ by ‘OCI Subnet OCID’

3. 'Entity Type' = 'OCI VCN Virtual Network Interface Card' and 'Log Source' = 'OCI VCN Flow Unified Schema Logs' | timestats count by 'OCI Subnet OCID'

4. ‘Entity Type’ = ‘OCI VCN Virtual Network Interface Card’ and ‘Log Source’ = ‘OCI VCN Flow Unified Schema Logs’ | stats count as logrecords by Entity

5. 'Entity Type' = 'OCI VCN Virtual Network Interface Card' and 'Log Source' = 'OCI VCN Flow Unified Schema Logs' | timestats avg('Packets In') by 'OCI Subnet OCID'

6. ‘Entity Type’ = ‘OCI VCN Virtual Network Interface Card’ and ‘Log Source’ = ‘OCI VCN Flow Unified Schema Logs’ | eval vol = ‘Content Size Out’ / (1024 * 1024) | timestats perhour(‘Packets In’) as ‘Packet Rate (per hr)’ by ‘OCI Subnet OCID’

## Task 3: Sample Instance Queries

1. ‘Log Source’ = ‘Linux Secure Logs’ and Service = sudo | stats count by ‘User Name (Originating)’

2. ‘Entity Type’ = ‘Host (Linux)’ and (‘invalid user’ or ‘user unknown’) | stats count”

3. ‘Entity Type’ = ‘Host (Linux)’ and ‘User Name’ != null and ‘User Authentication Method’ = publickey | timestats count by Entity

4. ‘Entity Type’ = ‘Host (Linux)’ | stats count as ‘Log Entries’ by ‘Log Source’ | top limit = 10 ‘Log Entries’

5. ‘Entity Type’ = ‘Host (Linux)’ and ‘User Name’ != null and ‘Host IP Address (Client)’ != null | stats count by ‘Host IP Address (Client)’, ‘User Name’

6. ‘Entity Type’ = ‘Host (Linux)’ | stats count as ‘Log Entries’ by Service | top limit = 10 ‘Log Entries’

7. ‘Entity Type’ = ‘Host (Linux)’ and not (‘invalid user’ or ‘user unknown’) | stats count

  You can now go to your dashboard and add these widgets to your EBS Dashboard

  Another option is to create a Networking/Security Dashboard with your networking queries in addition to your ebs dashboard where you can filter your EBS/host log metrics in the EBS Dashboard and Network and Audit information in the Networking/Security Dashboard. You can add this dashboard by clicking Create Dashboard, naming it and saving.

This will now complete this workshop.
