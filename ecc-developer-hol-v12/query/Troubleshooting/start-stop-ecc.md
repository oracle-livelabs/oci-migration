# Troubleshooting


### Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps needed to start and stop EBS apps services and  Enterprise Command Center Framework (ECC)


Estimated Time: 30 minutes


### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Learn how to start and stop ECC

### Prerequisites 

This lab assumes you have:
* Completed all previous labs successfully 
 

##  Task 1: Learn how to run adautoconfig,start & stop EBS apps 
1. Open EBS terminal and then run AutoConfig. For running Autoconfig you need to first source the EBS running edition using below command

    ```
  	 <copy>source /u01/install/APPS/EBSapps.env run</copy>
    ```
    ![Source EBS](../images/autoconfig1k.png "Source EBS")

2. Then, navigate to below location

    ```
  	 <copy>cd $ADMIN_SCRIPTS_HOME</copy>
    ```

    ![Navigate to ADMIN SCRIPTS HOME](../images/autoconfig2k.png "Navigate to ADMIN SCRIPTS HOME")

3. Run the below script

    ```
  	 <copy>./adautocfg.sh</copy>
    ```


4. It will prompt you for apps password which is by default **apps** 

    ![Run autoconfig](../images/autoconfig3k.png "Run autoconfig")
    ![Run autoconfig](../images/autoconfig101.png "Run autoconfig")

5. Once Autoconfig runs successfully then navigate to below location:

    ```
  	 <copy>cd $ADMIN_SCRIPTS_HOME</copy>
    ```



    ![Navigate to $ADMIN_SCRIPTS_HOME ](../images/adh12.png "Navigate to $ADMIN_SCRIPTS_HOME")




6. And then, run the following script to check OHS status:


    ```
  	 <copy>./adapcctl.sh status</copy>
    ```

    ![Check OHS status](../images/adh22.png "Check OHS status")

7. And then, run the following script to stop OHS regardless if OHS was UP/Down:


    ```
  	 <copy>./adapcctl.sh stop</copy>
    ```


    ![Stop OHS](../images/adh77.png "Stop OHS")   

8. And then, run the following script to start OHS:

    ```
  	 <copy>./adapcctl.sh start</copy>
    ```


    ![Start OHS](../images/adh44.png "Start OHS ")

9. And then, run the following script again to check the OHS status if it has successfully started:

    ```
  	 <copy> ./adapcctl.sh status</copy>
    ```



    ![Check OHS status](../images/adh55.png "Check OHS status")
 

## Task 2: Learn how to start and stop ECC

1. Start ECC

   Start the Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework servers by running the **./startAllEcc.sh** script located in the $ECC_BASE/Oracle/quickInstall/bin directory and choosing option 1 - All. This option starts the Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework managed server and the admin server in the required sequence. When prompted, enter the Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework domain admin server user name and password.

   ![Start ECC](../images/startecc1.png "Start ECC")


2. Stop ECC

   Stop the Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework servers by running the **./stopAllEcc.sh** script located in the $ECC_BASE/Oracle/quickInstall/bin directory and choosing option 1 - All. This option stops the Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework managed server and the admin server in the required sequence. When prompted, enter the Oracle Enterprise Command Center Framework domain admin server user name and password.
