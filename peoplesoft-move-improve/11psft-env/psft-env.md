# Creating Environment in PeopleSoft

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to provision and deploy an HCM PeopleSoft Environment from the previously created environment topolgy and template.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes + 90 minutes waiting for environment to delpoy

### Objectives

The purpose of this lab is to show you how to create a PeopleSoft Environment from an environment template in the PeopleSoft Cloud Manager.

In this lab, you will:
* Create a PeopleSoft Environment

### Prerequisites
- A PeopleSoft Cloud Manager Instance
- A PeopleSoft Environment Topology and Template 

## Task 1: Creating a New PeopleSoft Environment

1. Navigate to Cloud Manager Dashboard > **Environments**

3. Expand **Environment Attributes -> Full Tier -> Credentials**

    Give the following values to the fields:

    No. | Full Tier | Credentials
    --- | --------- | -----------
    2 | Database Operator Password | Psft1234
    4 | Database Access Password | Psft1234
    6 | Weblogic Administrator Password | Psft1234
    7 | Database Administrator Password | **Psft1234#**
    9 | Database Connect Password | Psft1234
    11 | Gateway Administrator Password | Psft1234
    12 | Web Profile Password for user PTWEBSERVER | Psft1234



  (All are the same except Database Adminitistrator Password)

## Task 2: Monitoring Infrastructure Creation

1. Refresh the page, and you'll see the status is **Initiating**.
    ![](./images/6initiating.png "")

2. Refresh again after a minute, and you'll see the status change to **Infra Creation In Progress**. Now, Click the arrow, and then **Details**

3. On the left, click **Logs**. Then, adjust the Number of Lines to Display and click **Fetch Logs**. You can take a monitor the infrastructure creation here. 
    ![](./images/8fetchlogs.png "")

It takes about 10 minutes to see the status change to **Infrastructure Creation Complete**:

## Task 3: Monitoring Deployment of PeopleSoft Environment

1. Now that the infrastructure has been created, we can deploy our environment. Click the arrow and **Deploy**
    ![](./images/10deploynew.png "")

  Then click **Yes** to confirm the provisioning.
    ![](./images/11yesdeploynew.png "")

2. Again, click the arrow for the **Details**
    ![](./images/12provisioning.png "")

  On the left, click **Provisioning Task Status** to see detailed progress status for every step. Click on **Deployment Tasks**. If any step fails, you can change the attribute as per the error and start the process from where it failed.
    ![](./images/13tasks.png "")

Provisioning takes about 90 minutes. You can monitor throughout this time.

3. Once your environment is in the **Running** status, go to **Details** again.

## Task 4: Signing in to PeopleSoft Environment

1. Set up a port forwarding session like we did in Lab 3 (Linux) & Lab 5 (Windows VM), making sure to select **hcm-fulltierlinux-1** in the dropdown of "Compute instance in Demo"
    ![](./images/sshhcm.png "")

    Next, add to your hosts file like we did previously
    ```
    <copy>
    127.0.0.1  hcmft-fulltierlinux-1.ft.psftvcn.oraclevcn.com
    </copy>
    ```
    Run the SSH port forward command in  Terminal or Git Bash, selecting a new port. (This time, I used 5000)
    ![](./images/portfwcommand.png "")
2. Enter the url in a browser
    ![](./images/hcmpia.png "")

3. Sign in using the following credentials

  ```
  Username : PS    
  Password: Psft1234
  ```
  ![](./images/hcmlogin.png "")
4. And voila- your HCM PeopleSoft Environment:
    ![](./images/hcmhome.png "")



## Task 5: Cloud Manager Actions for PeopleSoft Environment

We will cover Cloud Manager 13 features in depth in the following labs. Here is an **Overview** of the actions you can perform.

  ![](./images/actions.png "")
  The actions are:

  • **Details**: Select this option to view environment details and to perform additional actions on the environment such as performing a health check, applying a PeopleTools patch, viewing logs, and managing PUM connections.

  • **Start**: Select this option to start all the instances and then all the domains within them.

  • **Stop**: Select this option to stop all domains and shutdown all the instances. In case of database, only compute database instances are shutdown.

  • **Delete**: Select this option to remove the environment.

  • **Manage Node**: Select this option to scale environment up or down.

  • **Clone Environment** (Lab 12): Select this option to clone an existing environment.

  • **Backup and Restore** (Lab 13): Select this option to backup or restore an environment.

You may follow the rest of the labs for even more features:

  • **Patch Environment** (Lab 14): Patch an environment.

  • **Upgrade Environment** (Lab 15): Upgrade an environment.

  • **Create Policies** (Lab 16): Execute policies such as starting and stopping an environment.

  • **Selective Adoption** (Lab 17): Create a PUM connection between a source and target environment. 

  • **Refresh** (Lab 18): Select this option to refresh the database or the database, ps app home and ps cust home.  
  This option is only available for DBaaS environments.


You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
