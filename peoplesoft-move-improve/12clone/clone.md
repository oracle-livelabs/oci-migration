# Cloning an Environment

## Introduction
The Clone Environment action can be used to duplicate an exact copy of an existing PeopleSoft environment running in Cloud Manager. The new environment is built by reconfiguring the disks from deep clone. This process saves both installation and deployment time. Once the cloned environment is running, you can perform scaling and Lifecycle Management actions.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes + 30 minutes for cloning

### Objectives
In this lab you will:
* Clone an existing environment

### Prerequisites
- Access to the Cloud Manager console
- A PeopleSoft Environment up and running on Cloud Manager

## Task 1: Creating a Clone of an Environment

1.  Navigate to **Dashboard** > **Environments**. On the environment that we just created (**HCMFT**) click the down arrow and then click **Clone Environment**.

    Note on the **Environment Details** page, under **Status** you will see a red exclamation point. This will remain until the entire environment has successfully provisioned. Once provisioned, the status will change to a green check mark.

    On the side menu click **Logs**. From here you can monitor the status of your clone environment.

    You can also go to **Provision Task Status** on the side menu to see detailed progress status for every step.

    Once the environment has a green dot with a status of **Running** you have successfully created a clone of your environment.

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
