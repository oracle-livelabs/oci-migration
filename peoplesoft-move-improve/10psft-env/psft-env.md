# Creating Environment in PeopleSoft

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to provision and deploy an HCM PeopleSoft Environment from the previously created environment topology and template.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes + 90 minutes waiting for environment to deploy

### Objectives

The purpose of this lab is to show you how to create a PeopleSoft Environment from an environment template in the PeopleSoft Cloud Manager.

In this lab, you will:
* Create a PeopleSoft Environment

### Prerequisites
- A PeopleSoft Cloud Manager Instance
- A PeopleSoft Environment Topology and Template 

## Task 1: Creating a New PeopleSoft Environment

1. Navigate to Cloud Manager Dashboard > **Environments**  
    ![Navigate to Cloud Manager Dashboard and then Environments](./images/dashenv.png "")

  Click **Create Environment** button.

    ![Click Create Environment button](./images/clickenv.png "")

2. Provide a unique Environment Name - **HCMFT**.

3. Description **HCM 9.2 with Full Tier. Linux and Windows nodes**



 Select the Template that was created in previous section – **PUMFT**. Click **yes** for **Pause after infra creation**.  

    ![Provide a unique Environment Name and select the Template that was created in previous section](./images/newenvinfo.png "")

3. Expand **Environment Attributes -> Full Tier -> Credentials**

    Entries should already be pre-populated:

  ![Check and validate the credentials](./images/credentials.png "")

4. Expand PeopleSoft Client -> **Credentials**

  Windows password should have come across from the vault **PSVault**
    ![Enter the password for the windows environment](./images/winenvpass.png "")

5. Scroll up and click **Done** on the top right to begin the environment creation process. 

    ![Hit done to begin with environment creation](./images/envbuild.png "")

## Task 2: Monitoring Infrastructure Creation

1. Refresh the page, and you'll see the status is **Initiating**.
    ![Refresh the page to see the environment status](./images/initiating.png "")

2. Refresh again after a minute, and you'll see the status change to **Infra Creation In Progress**. Now, Click the arrow, and then **Details**
    ![Click on arrow to see the details page](./images/inprogress.png "")

3. On the left, click **Logs**. Then, adjust the Number of Lines to Display and click **Fetch Logs**. You can take a monitor the infrastructure creation here. 
    ![Click on logs to get the status of logs for the environment](./images/fetchlogs.png "")

It takes about 10 minutes to see the status change to **Infrastructure Creation Complete**:
    ![Infrastructure status changes to complete](./images/infracomplete.png "")



## Task 3: Monitoring Deployment of PeopleSoft Environment

1. Now that the infrastructure has been created, we can deploy our environment. Click the arrow and **Deploy**
    ![Click the arrow and start the deployment process](./images/deploynew.png "")

  Then click **Yes** to confirm the provisioning.
    ![Click the arrow for the details](./images/yesdeploy.png "")

2. Again, click the arrow for the **Details**
    ![Click the arrow for the details again](./images/12provisioning.png "")

  On the left, click **Provisioning Task Status** to see detailed progress status for every step. Click on **Deployment Tasks**. If any step fails, you can change the attribute as per the error and start the process from where it failed.
    ![Click Provisioning Task Status to see detailed progress status for every step](./images/tasks.png "")

Provisioning takes about 90 minutes. You can monitor throughout this time.

3. Once your environment is in the **Running** status, go to **Details** again.
    ![Once your environment is in the Running status, go to details again](./images/details.png "")

## Task 4: Signing in to PeopleSoft Environment

1. Set up a port forwarding session like we did in Lab 3 (Linux) & Lab 5 (Windows VM), making sure to select **hcm-fulltierlinux-1** in the dropdown of "Compute instance in Demo"
    ![Set up a port forwarding session for the environment](./images/sshhcm.png "")

    Next, add to your hosts file like we did previously
    ```
    <copy>
    127.0.0.1  hcmft-fulltierlinux-1.ft.psftcm.oraclevcn.com
    </copy>
    ```
    Run the SSH port forward command in  Terminal or Git Bash, selecting a new port. (This time, I used 5000)
    ![Run the SSH port forward command in Terminal or Git Bash, selecting a new port](./images/portfwcommand.png "")
2. Enter the url in a browser
    ![Enter the url in a browser](./images/hcmpia.png "")

3. Sign in using the following credentials

  ```
  <copy>
  Username : PS    
  Password: PS
  </copy>
  ```
  ![Sign in using the following credentials](./images/hcmlogin.png "")
4. And voila- your HCM PeopleSoft Environment:
    ![You have successfully logged into the environment](./images/hcmhome.png "")



## Task 5: Cloud Manager Actions for PeopleSoft Environment

We will cover the latest Cloud Manager features in depth in the following labs. Here is an **Overview** of the actions you can perform.

  ![Here is an Overview of the actions you can perform](./images/actions.png "")
  The actions are:

  • **Details**: Select this option to view environment details and to perform additional actions on the environment such as performing a health check, applying a PeopleTools patch, viewing logs, and managing PUM connections.

  • **Start**: Select this option to start all the instances and then all the domains within them.

  • **Stop**: Select this option to stop all domains and shutdown all the instances. In case of database, only compute database instances are shutdown.

  • **Delete**: Select this option to remove the environment.

  • **Manage Node**: Select this option to scale environment up or down.

  • **Clone Environment** (Lab 12): Select this option to clone an existing environment.

  • **Backup and Restore** (Lab 13): Select this option to backup or restore an environment.

You may follow the rest of the labs for even more features:

  • **Patch Environment** (Lab 14): Patch an environment.

  • **Upgrade Environment** (Lab 15): Upgrade an environment.

  • **Create Policies** (Lab 16): Execute policies such as starting and stopping an environment.

  • **Selective Adoption** (Lab 17): Create a PUM connection between a source and target environment. 

  • **Refresh** (Lab 18): Select this option to refresh the database or the database, PS APP HOME and PS CUST HOME.  
  This option is only available for DBaaS environments.


You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
