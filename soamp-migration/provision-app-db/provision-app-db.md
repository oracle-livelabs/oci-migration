## Introduction

This lab with guide you through provisioning a Application Database

Estimated Lab Time: 30 to 35 minutes including 25 to 30 minutes provisioning time.

15. Enter and confirm the **SYS Database password**.

    You can create your own password or use the following (used in further steps):

    ```
    <copy>
    WELcome##123
    </copy>
    ```

16. Keep the default **Transaction Processing** option for **Workload type** and for **Backup**.

17. Optionally you can select **Enable automatic backups** for the period of `60 days` and scheduling `Anytime`.

18. Click **Create DB System**.

  This will usually take up to 40 minutes to provision.

## Task 2: Check the Status of the Database Provisioning

Before you can proceed to the next lab, you need to check that the database has been fully provisioned.

1. Go to **Oracle Databases -> BM, VM, Exadata**.

2. Make sure you are in the correct Compartment.

3. Check the status of the database is `Available` or wait until it is before proceeding.
