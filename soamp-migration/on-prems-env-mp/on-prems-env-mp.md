# Set up an 'on-premises' environment using the workshop image

## Introduction

For this migration workshop, we need an environment to migrate *from*.

This lab walks you through setting up an environment to simulate an established SOA 12.2.1.3 on-premises environment, using a Compute instance on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure OCI deployed through the marketplace.

At the end of this lab, you will have a simulated 'on-premises' environment running with an Oracle SOA Suite 12.2.1.3 VM containing an Oracle Database 12c, WebLogic Server 12c, and Jdeveloper 12.2.1.4, along with a demo application to be migrated.

>Note: Jdeveloper 12.2.1.4 is required to upgrade the application code from 12.2.1.3 to 12.2.1.4 to migrate to the SOAMP 12.2.1.4 on OCI.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab you will:

- Launch the demo environment image from Marketplace.
- Check that the services are up and running.

### Prerequisites

For this lab you need:

- A bare metal compute instance with at least 4 OCPUs (8 preferred) available to run the image.
- Microsoft Remote Desktop Client (or similar RDP client) installed to connect to the demo environment.
    
    >Note: The workshop will run on a VM instance but will be very very slow, so it is not recommended.  

## Task 1: Launch the Workshop Marketplace Stack

1. Navigate to [Workshop Environment Marketplace Stack](https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/listing/84694612)

2. Click **Get App**.

    get app(./images/1-get-app.png)

3. Select OCI Region and sign in to your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account.

    ![select region](./images/2-sign-in.png)

4. Select the compartment you prepared to run this workshop.

5. Accept the Terms and Conditions and click **Launch**.

    ![launch](./images/4-soa-workshop-mp1.png)

6. Provide an optional name and description, and click **Next**.

    ![next](./images/5-next.png)

7. Choose a shape.

  The image will work on a VM shape but will be very slow. It is highly recommended to use a Bare Metal shape such as BM.Standard.E3.128 or BM.Standard.E2.x.

  Make sure the shape you chose is available in your tenancy.

7. Browse to your **SSH Public Key**.

   To connect to the SOA servers via SSH, you need to provide a public key the server will use to identify your computer.

    ![ssh key](./images/6-ssh-key.png)

8. Click **Next** and then **Create**.

    ![next](./images/7-next.png)

    ![running job](./images/8-job-running.png)

  It will take about 1 to 2 minutes to create the stack. 

8. When the job finishes, you can find the public IP address of the instance at the bottom of the logs, or in the **Output** area. Make a note of this information.

## Task 2: Connect to the Demo Environment

*It will take another 4 to 5 minutes for all the services to come online.*.

Connect to the instance using your RDP Client (the follwoing steps show the process using Microsoft Remote Desktop Client).

1. Add a new host, providing the public IP gathered from the stack output.

    ![rdp add a host](./images/rdp-add-host.png)

2. Connect using username `oracle` and password `oracle`.

3. If you have issues with display sizing, edit the connection and go to `Display` settings to adjust screen size.

## Task 3: Launch the SOA Domain

1. Click `SOA and Compact Domain` on the VM desktop.

    ![soa desktop](./images/soa-desktop.png)

2. Double-click on the `Start soa_domain Admin Server` script to start the domain Admin Server.

    ![run soa admin server](./images/soa-admin.png)

3. Wait for the admin server to be running. This will take 2 to 3 minutes.

    You will see state changed to `RUNNING` in the logs.

    ![soa running](./images/soa-admin-running.png)

4. Double click on the `Start soa_domain SOA Server` script to start the SOA server.

    ![start soa server](./images/soa-soa.png)

    ![soa server logs](./images/soa-soa-console.png)


## Task 4: Check the Local Environment

1. Once the domains are started, open the Firefox web browser and select the bookmark for EM (Enterprise Manager), which points to `http://localhost:7001/em` to open the EM console.


2. Log in using usename `weblogic`, and password `welcome1`.

    ![login](./images/em-login.png)

3. Check that the admin server and SOA domain are running (other domains will not be running and that is normal).

    ![status](./images/soa-desktop-em-status.png)

You may proceed to the next lab.
