# Introduction

## About this Workshop

WildFly is the open source version of the well-known JBoss web server.

This lab will walk you through the process of migrating an existing on-premises JBoss application to WildFly on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The application we will migrate is a Java application with a datasource connecting to a database that will be migrated to Oracle Autonomous Database on OCI along with the application.

Estimated Lab Time: 80 minutes

### About Product/Technology

### Objectives

*Perform the end-to-end migration of a JBoss/WildFly application to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) with an Oracle Autonomous Database, provisioning with terraform.*

In this lab, you will:
- Provision a demo environment to use as the on-premises environment to be migrated.
- Provision a JBoss/WildFly cluster on OCI, with an Autonomous Database with Terraform.
- Migrate the application database from the on-premises environment to the Oracle Autonomous Database.
- Migrate the application to the JBoss/WildFly deployment on OCI.
- Optionally learn to scale the JBoss/WildFly cluster.
- Tear down the workshop.

* A Mac OS X, Windows or Linux machine.
* An SSH key-pair.
